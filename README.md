### Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Dave Conley

- ðŸ”­ Most Recently, I started medicalSymptomsFE in June, 2022. I then created medicalSymptomsBE in August after I had laid out a lot of the structure and state management of the front-end. The front-end is built with the React, Typescript, Redux, and I used React Testing Library and Jest to test my components. The backend is built with Node.js, Typescript, and Express frameworks, and I used knex as my database schema and query tool to manage the data in PostgresSQl. The app has an e-commerce theme where I provide the ability for a user to create an account, login, look a consumer reviews of products, make a review, take a survey for a product recommendation, and add products to the customers cart.  

- ðŸ”­ Additionally, a several months back I built an app for users to keep track of all of their plants and how often they should water each one. It is a full stack application that I built and deployed on Heroku. It is called build-week-scaffolding-node in my github repository. Some feature highlights include building login capability with encrypted passwords, rest api on an express server with get, post, put, delete endpoints for plant data and login credentials, and the ability for a user to upload a plant image to their plant card that is saved in an Amazon s3 bucket.

- ðŸŒ± I know Javascript, React, Redux, TypeScript, Express, Jest, React Testing Library, and Node.js. If you have any tips or would like to connect about an opportunity, I have put my contact information below.
