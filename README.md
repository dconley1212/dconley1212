### Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Dave Conley

- ðŸ”­ Most Recently, I started a project where I decided to learn typescript and use it in my project. I wanted to sharpen my redux skills, so I made sure to incorporate redux on the front-end. The project is called medicalSymptomsFE, which I have been working on the last month and a half. It has been so much fun! Obviously, there have been frustrating days when I run into problems, but I find so much joy in watching my ability grow and putting the work in every day.

- ðŸ”­ Additioanlly, a couple months back I built an app for users to keep track of all of their plants and how often they should water each one. It is a full stack application that I built and deployed on Heroku. It is called build-week-scaffolding-node in my github repository. Some feature highlights include building login capability with encrypted passwords, rest api on an express server with get, post, put, delete endpoints for plant data and login credentials, and the ability for a user to upload a plant image to their plant card that is saved in an Amazon s3 bucket.

- ðŸŒ± I know Javascript, React, Redux, TypeScript, Express, and Node.js. If you have any tips or would like to connect about an opportunity, I have put my contact information below.
